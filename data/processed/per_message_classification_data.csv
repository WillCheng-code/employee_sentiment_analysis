In previous years Enron has sponsored athletic tournaments for it's 
employees.  I have participated in tournaments ranging from softball to flag 
football.  In addition, Enron has been very invloved with charitable 
organizations in the community.  With these two things in mind, I wanted to 
propose a flag football tournament to benefit a charitable organiztion.  I 
know that some of the budgets for sports clubs have been reduced (including 
flag football) recently.  This is a way that Enron can support employee 
interaction and wellness and, at the same time, give back to the community.

My questions are : Is this idea plausible?  If so, who should I contact with

I've updated the transmission rates table for May - here is the location:

M:ElectricEast Volume MgmtTransmissionTransmission Rates

If there is a better spot for this to make it more accessible just let me 
know and I can put a copy of it whereever.

Couple of other trends I've noticed that hopefully can be corrected...

First Energy transmission is now and has been for a while under the 
counterparty American Transmission Systems, Inc. (ATSI)
Duke transmission should be under the Duke counterparty Duke Electric 
Transmission (DUKEELETRA)
Georgia's ancillary service charges have changed although their website has 
not be updated - price changed from $2.57 to $2.49

Please pass this along to the rest of the group, if any of you have any 
questions or suggestions - don't hesitate to call.

Re:,"Frank,

The implied risk created by the san juan and rockies indeces being partially set after today is the same as the risk in a long futures position.  Whatever the risk was prior should not matter.  Since the rest of the books are very short price this should be a large offset.  If the VAR calculation does not match the company's true risk then it needs to be revised or adjusted.

We Got the Money!!,"
As I alluded to in my note yesterday, Enron has received a commitment for $1 billion in additional credit from our agent banks. This is great news, more from a market perception standpoint than an actual cash need. You can be assured that senior management is totally focused on the need to shore up the balance sheet with additional equity, now that we have the debt in place, but the equity we be a longer process.

In the meantime, lets get back to work. I would encourage people to talk to their supervisors about this situation if you feel ""angst"".

I think we reached an agreement with George and Larry to pick up the items of 
value and not pay any fees for their time.  It looks as if we will be able to 
use everything they have done (engineering, architecture, survey, 
appraisal).  One point that is unclear is they claim that the $15,000 in 
extensions that they paid was applied to the purchase price of the land like 
earnest money would be applied.  I looked at the closing statements and I 
didn't see $15,000 applied against the purchase price.  Can you help clear 
this up.

Assuming we clear up the $15,000, we need to get the property released.  
Keith and I are concerned about taking over the Bishop Corner partnership and 
the risk that there could be undisclosed liabilities.  On the other hand, 
conveyance of the partnership would be a time and money saver if it was 
clean.  What is your inclination?

SEPA and schedules,"Hey guys,

I talked to Kayne on Monday about the various contracts we have with MDEA to ensure they continued for 2002.  KOCH, NRG, and SEPA all carry over. However, as Mike confirmed in checkouts, SEPA does NOT flow on weekends or holidays and SEPA puts out the tag without consulting us even though the schedule changes regularly.   Currently there is no SEPA schedule in OATI or the services contract book starting 01/07/2002.   Make sure when we do the next day schedules the SEPA contract matches OATI once SEPA puts out the new tags.

Last month we didn't have to place as close attention when scheduling because SEPA put out a tag for the entire month and Laura matched it in the services book for us. 

And for your reference, the January Entergy OASIS #  for WR to MDEA (30MW all day) is: 1025604 (Daily NN-6).  

Happy New Year!

I'm pleased to note that you will once again be my PRC Rep.  Since the time 
we talked a couple of weeks earlier in your office, I have rotated out of the 
Middle East Development Group as of 10/31/00 and joined Larry Lawyer's 
Finance Group in EGM.  I'm really excited about my new rotation.  With 
regards to my work over the last 6 months, I'd be happy to give you a 
personal account of my achievements at a time convenient to you.  Meanwhile, 
should you need any information from my end, pls call me at x-54326.

RAC risk reporting,"Currently, members of Ted Murphy's group have been preparing certain 
non-standard reports at the request of commercial.  These reports can be 
categorized as:

""morning report"" - daily
Component V@R - daily
Adhoc V@R - as needed
Book reconciliation - as needed
Stress testing - as needed
Back testing - weekly
Correlation Matrix - bi-weekly


I have obtained a copy of all reports currently being prepared.  In the 
upcoming weeks we need to transfer the preparation of these reports from RAC 
to Risk Operations.  In order to do that, on a report by report basis, we 
need to determine what group within Risk Operations should prepare these 
reports (Risk Management and Controls or the individual commodity risk 
management groups).

In the next couple days,  I will be sending you each a listing of reports 
prepared, and then set up a time to meet with you so we can determine the 
best way to go forward.

Order re. transfer of operational control to MISO,"On July 27, 2001, the Commission approved the application of Minnesota Power and Superior Water, Light and Power Company to transfer operational control of certain jurisdictional transmission facilities to the Midwest ISO when it becomes operational.

With regard to the Midwest RTO, the Commission stated its approval of the transfer of operational control does not constitute a finding regarding the scope of an RTO for the Midwest.

I gave this presentation to John Sherriff, Richard Lewis and Joe Gold this 
afternoon - lots of interesting feedback !

Would love to take you through this  - I also took Joel Henenberg through an 
early draft version and suggested we should discuss it on a call with 
yourself and Mary next week.

There are some significant issues arise around Thunderball and Global Markets 
which we have started to discuss with Kevin Swenney and Cindy Horn ( I missed 
my opportunity to take Brent through all the issues this afternoon but will 
try to get to him soon ).

Hope all is well - speak to you soon

RE: TV,"So this is how it will work.  Whenever the payment is due (the 18th).  You 
write me a check for $100.  I will pay the $1252.  

You will pay me $100/ month for 13 months ( so you last payment will be made 
to me on October 18th, 2001).
Payments will be due to me on the 18th of every month - NO EXCEPTIONS -  I 
cannot do this deal if you do not pay me on time - I will not make any 
exceptions for you.

Let me know if this is ok with you and I will work up a contract.

trading in India,"By way of introduction, I am the director of global risk operations reporting 
to Sally Beck.  One of my responsibilities is to help new Enron offices set 
up risk control functions.  I have been speaking with Milind Laad and Heidi 
Hellman, located in India, concerning the marketing and origination of coal, 
liquid fuels, gas and power transacted by the Indian office.

I was wondering what your understanding of the Indian office's 
trading/marketing/origination plans are as coal and liquids and what type of 
trading authorizations you have given them to date.  I understand that any 
coal deals done by India will be included in George's book and any liquids 
deals done will be included in John's book.

Thanks,

have determined that all discretionary prudency and general reserves 
(including VAR based prudency) should be eliminated. Deal specific prudency 
will, however, remain. In order to avoid any arguments with AA near the 
quarter end the release to the London summary DPR should happen today for the 
August month end.

recently. Please pass this message around to those people in your groups who 
are not on the above mail list so that 'everyone' is aware of the change.

Hourly Trading,"Hello Don,

I am trying to get a job in the 24 hour trading group.  I was speaking with John Zurita and he said that
you would be a good person to contact.  Currently, I am in the Risk Controls Group with EES working

 ",2010-09-05,eric.bass@enron.com,"Hourly Trading Hello Don,

I am trying to get a job in the 24 hour trading group.  I was speaking with John Zurita and he said that
you would be a good person to contact.  Currently, I am in the Risk Controls Group with EES working 
strictly with Power deals.  I have been running a small group for the past year called the Contract Post-Pricing Group.  
In addition, I have experience in the Power Underwriting Group and have exposure to various pricing 
strategies, concepts and products.  

I have attached my resume that will give you more detail about my work experience.

I will give you a call later today.

MISO Approved for Start Up of Transmission Functions,"Yesterday, FERC gave approval for MISO to begin regional transmission operations on December 15, 2001.  This will include administration of their regional transmission tariff, security coordination, and ""other regional transmission organization functions.""  I expect they are going to function very similarly to the manner in which SPP and MAPP currently operate.  I verified this with Roger Harzy at the MISO, and he confirmed they plan to be operational on Dec. 15th.

I will be at MISO next week Tuesday and Wednesday, and will be working to make sure we are set up to take service under their tariff and fully understand their operations. If you have any specific questions, please send me mail, and I will work to address them while I am visiting.

This will include administration of their regional transmission tariff, security coordination, and ""other regional transmission organization functions.""  I expect they are going to function very similarly to the manner in which SPP and MAPP currently operate.  I verified this with Roger Harzy at the MISO, and he confirmed they plan to be operational on Dec. 15th.

I will be at MISO next week Tuesday and Wednesday, and will be working to make sure we are set up to take service under their tariff and fully understand their operations. If you have any specific questions, please send me mail, and I will work to address them while I am visiting.

See the attached Electric Power Daily article for more detail (sidebar, p1).

Just wanted to get this out to you in the hope that you havent worked on January's and this month's schedule. I had already planned to be in Denver to ski (know any good resorts?) and then spend the new year with my family..earlier the plan was to do this from the26th onwards..as scheduled, but since we might not get our vacation from Enron at all.. I was wondering if everything being exegient, I could take off a little early and arrive into say the 4th or so of Jan?

This of course being that I dont upset too many other schedules and no news occurs upon us which would preclude this.

Also on an unrelated note..the people from Trader News called and wanted prices,...but I have not sent them anything not knowing our legal position on the same.

RAC risk reporting,"Currently, members of Ted Murphy's group have been preparing certain 
non-standard reports at the request of commercial.  These reports can be 
categorized as:

""morning report"" - daily
Component V@R - daily
Adhoc V@R - as needed
Book reconciliation - as needed
Stress testing - as needed
Back testing - weekly
Correlation Matrix - bi-weekly


I have obtained a copy of all reports currently being prepared.  In the 
upcoming weeks we need to transfer the preparation of these reports from RAC 
to Risk Operations.  In order to do that, on a report by report basis, we 
need to determine what group within Risk Operations should prepare these 
reports (Risk Management and Controls or the individual commodity risk 
management groups).

In the next couple days,  I will be sending you each a listing of reports 
prepared, and then set up a time to meet with you so we can determine the 
best way to go forward.

Re: FW: LNG Weekly Update,"Looks good.  certainly an area we need more focus on.  Obviously the most 
important aspect of lng is how much gas is coming in, what is that relative 
to last year, and what new capacity is coming longer term.  
As an aside, nat gas trades as a funciton of the storage spread to last year 
and five year averages.  It would be very useful if all fundamental analysis 
were geared the same way.  The fact that lng shipments are x this week is 
meaningless.  the fact that they are y delta of last year is extremely 
useful.  if you noticed in the fundies meeting, i was trying to move 
discussion that way.  what's switching vis a vis last year.   whats 
production relative to last year.  it simplifies the fundamental analysis.

FINAL DECISION ON ACCRUAL VALUE,"Tom has come to a decision on what to do with the ubiquitous accrual value.  
60% of this value should be credited to Greg's Transport expense on a monthly 
basis.  Tom, in turn, will cover Ed on this portion of the expense.

For example:

Accrual Value comes out to be $300,000 for the month of April.

This means that:

Greg's portion of this value is 60% of $300,000 = $180,000
Tom's portion of this value is 40% of $300,000 = $120,000

Greg's Transport Expense is ($700,000)
So, Tom will cover                      $180,000 of this expense
Greg's adjusted Expense is   ($520,000)

Greg's P&L is net better off by the $180,000 of accrual value
Tom's P&L is net better off by $120,000  of accrual value which had not been 
previously recognized.
Ed's P&L is net unchanged from all of the above.

Enron Japan Trading,"Hi,  How is everyone doing?  Busy , Busy, Busy I know.

I am currently in the middle of selecting our Japan Banking Relationship and 
several questions have come up.

It is important that I understand how your trading settlements will work.

I have spoken to Louise Kitchen about Enron Online and where it fits in with 
our banking.  Enron Online does not interface with the banking.  It 
interfaces with a trading system/accounting system?  What I need to know is 
what system is planned for Enron Japan's accounting for the trading.  The 
accounting system you use will interface with our Treasury system.

What it boils down to, is the payment format that we will use to make local 
Japanese payments may need special programming to meet the needs of the 
Japanese  - English translation. The accounting system used will need to 
interface with our Treasury software to process the settlements, we will need 
to interface with the bank.  

  Please advise.

*Updated* Nightly Duties and MDEA Load sheets folder,"Hello all,

Attached is an updated sheet regarding what needs to be done at night regarding MDEA and our old nightly duties. 

Also there is now a folder near the MAPP printer (between Dean and Don) that will include all the nightly faxes and load sheets.  The folder will help us keep track of what has been faxed in case EES trans calls complaining.  The load sheets are needed for the daily forecasting expained in the SOP 13 Dean sent out last week. In the folder there are extra copies of the SOP 13 in case you want it as well as GENCO phone numbers in case Allegheny calls. 

Hopefully this will help create some consistency on nights and provide the day people access to the MDEA load sheets.  If you have any questions please give me a ring.

Happy Holidays,

Re: Dec99 Enron North America Wholesale Volumes,"Thanks for your help.

There really are no material changes for Texas.  The only issue that I see is 
the month to month change in volumes between December and November 99.  This 
was due primarily to slightly cooler temperatures (Entex takes were slightly 
higher) and an extra day of flow (31 vs. 30).  Let me know if you have 
further questions.

Message from Rusty,"The following is a message fro Rusty about the grant that the city got to
purchase the land at the back of CCV:

I talked with Peggy this morning. We want to get all the facts and
stipulations laid out for the grant. This will keep any falsehoods from being
spread. We want to encourage all residents to express their feelings, but we
need good facts. It is our intent to get all the facts and try to make this a
positive thing for our residents.

Russ",2010-12-04,john.arnold@enron.com,"Message from Rusty The following is a message fro Rusty about the grant that the city got to
purchase the land at the back of CCV:

I talked with Peggy this morning. We want to get all the facts and
stipulations laid out for the grant. This will keep any falsehoods from being
spread. We want to encourage all residents to express their feelings, but we
need good facts. It is our intent to get all the facts and try to make this a
positive thing for our residents.

The city has always been very good about working with us and we appreciate it.

Thanks

  Gas Sales 916,000/day x 365 days = 334,340,000/year
  
  Estimated Gas Prices $985,721,000/334,340,000= $2.95/mcf

  Actual gas prices are around $1.00/mcf higher and rising. 

   Recalc of EPS with more accurate gas prices:
  (334,340,000 mct X $1/mcf)/116,897,000 shares outst = $2.86 additional EPS 
X 12 P/E multiple = $34 a share


 That is just a back of the envelope valuation based on gas prices.  I think 
crude price are undervalued by the tune of $10/share.

 Current price 37
 Nat. Gas 34
 Crude  10

 Total  81

 
 Can you take a look at these numbers and play devil's advocate?  To me this 
looks like the best stock to own Also can you send me a report on Calpine, 
Tosco, and SLB?


Thank you,

 Phillip

- RAC will help design and participate as required in inspections
- I will be able to see, through the RAC website, a list of all offices, a 
list of all offices requiring inspection, when an office was inspected, 
findings from that inspection and the follow-up from the findings.
- If follow up is not happening, a ""red flagged"" reminder notice should be

one ball that can not be dropped.

Kirit Purbhoo Resume,"Hi Don,

Attached please find my resume for your review.  I liked to thank you for allowing me to sit with the shift guys for the past few nights.  The exposure has been invaluable.  I worked closely with Joe Errigo, who has been extremely helpful in showing me the routine of the job.  I received some hands on training with some of the work that is expected from the shift crew.  In particular, checkouts, price discovery, identifying constraint paths, input deals into the P&L  and Enpower.  

The demanding and fast paced nature of this position is exactly what appeals to me.  My past experience with trading and scheduling should provide a good base.  I would like to sit down with you and discuss opportunities within your group.  Again, thank you for the opportunity, hope to hear from you soon.

Emily's First Pictures,"Just so you can see where my paycheck now goes.  What a great way to spend 
money!

Here are some pictures from the first roll of film - Emily was about 5 or 6 
days old.  She brings me joy I never thought possible.  And I'm sure some day 
she'll bring me some pain, but I'm not thinking about that right now.  I 
didn't know how easy it was to fall in love.  I am a different person 
(better) because of her.  
Yesterday, we made our first trip to the pediatrician and he said that she 
was doing fine.  She gained  7 ounces!  She's quite a good little eater.  We 
are settling into a routine and she sleeps about 4 hours at a time so it 
gives me time to get a fair amount of rest.  We'll probably make a trip down 
to the EB in a few weeks and I'll be sure to let you know exactly when.  I 
hope you all are doing well -- stay in touch.  Here's the pictures.....(by

*Updated* Nightly Duties and MDEA Load sheets folder,"Hello all,

Attached is an updated sheet regarding what needs to be done at night regarding MDEA and our old nightly duties. 

Also there is now a folder near the MAPP printer (between Dean and Don) that will include all the nightly faxes and load sheets.  The folder will help us keep track of what has been faxed in case EES trans calls complaining.  The load sheets are needed for the daily forecasting expained in the SOP 13 Dean sent out last week. In the folder there are extra copies of the SOP 13 in case you want it as well as GENCO phone numbers in case Allegheny calls. 

Hopefully this will help create some consistency on nights and provide the day people access to the MDEA load sheets.  If you have any questions please give me a ring.

Happy Holidays,

Carrie

Status on Hiring,"Hi Don,

  I was just following up to my last email regarding the status of job opportunities in your group.  I had a death in the family and was out last week.  I know you guys are probably coming up on bidweek now and have very little time to interview.  I would really like a one on one with you to discuss opportunities as soon as you can  make some time available.  As I mentioned before, having had the opportunity to go up and observe the guys helped tremendously.  Thank you again for that.  This is exactly  what I want to do.  I hate to come out sounding like a pest, but, I am eager to start.   I want to work the night shift and get back into the fasted paced environment.  Thank you for your time, Don, hoping to hear from you soon.  

Sincerely,

Zarin Imam

friendship.  In particular (in order of appearance): Dung Tran, Jon Doyle,
Dave Ramm, Natalie Halich, Roberto Silveira and Rick Waddell have been great
sources of learning and leadership.

'Other opportunities' means exactly that - not quite sure what the next
adventure will be, but it won't be boring!  I encourage you to reply with
your personal e-mail etc., so that we can keep in touch.

All the best,

Re: Hi,"Hey Mom,

Things are well.  Just looking forward to the weekend.  We are going to Happy 
Hour tonight to celebrate Tim's engagement.  Shanna is going to visit Toni 
tomorrow, apparently she has taken a turn for the worse.  Other than that, 
just trying to get back into the work groove after all of that vacation.  

How are things on the homefront?

OU Salaries,"Sally,

Just something from a recruiting prospective for us to think about, 
remembering the situation from last fall of George making the mistake of 
extending verbal offers, quoting incorrect salaries, and the difference being 
recovered by your RC, I wanted to bring the potential of a residual OU salary 
issue to your attention.  

The salary being offered for another internship or full-time position, which 
ever applies, may appear (to the OU candidates) to be wrong.  Interns will 
enter the program at the same pay rate, $3,000 monthly and the full-time 
analysts at 40k.  As you know, both salaries are non-negotiable for 
consistency amongst the program participants.  

I'm sure questions will come up regarding compensation and thought we could 
discuss the inevitable.  I would really like your input on how to ""soften the 
blow"".

I look forward to your response.
Thanks

In case you haven't arrived by the time I leave I wanted to fill you in on tonight's activities.  
JD explained the MHEB relationship and how we should move there power.  As a result I moved 100MW from MHEB to AECI HE 7 & 8 (tag DPL8643).
Be sure to notice the huge profit I raked in on the deal.  
100 MW was all they could give me (they originally told us 200 but at HE 2 they called to cut that down to only 100)
I put the deal in the services p&l under MHEB but I didn't empower the deal because I didn't know which book to put it in. 
I will be in tonight in case we need to go over this in detail.

Dream Matchup,"Unfortunately the Dream Matchup has been nixed by the Cotton Bowl.  UT is no 
longer in consideration for a Cotton Bowl berth.  It would have been fun to

Re: Visit,"Hey Aunt Bonnie,

I thoroughly enjoyed your visit as well.  It has been too long since the last 
time we got together.  I hope that we get to see more of each other in the 
coming years.   Hopefully, we can make a trip up to Pennsylvania soon.

Love,

Eric

Power Trader Position,"I saw a job posting for a Power Trader (24-Hr real time) in the Enron 
intranet and I was wandering if we could meet to discuss further. 

I have been with Enron for about a year doing power origination and trading 
in Latin America. I recently moved back to the US and have been working with 
EES for a couple of months. Before Enron I worked a few years in PSEG trading 
and Constellation Power Source, but not as a trader. I know the northeast 
(PJM mainly) power markets (24 hour) fairly well. I have always been 
interested in getting into the trading business and that's why this position 
caught my attention.

I hope you feel there may be a potential match here. If you think so, please 
let me know and I can forward you my resume.

Thank you

End of Season,"Eric,

Thanks for running the league.  It was fun.  And
thanks for selecting Boumann as your QB in the first
round of the playoffs.  And tell P-Love that I
appreciated him leaving Warner for me at the 7th pick
in the draft.

Anyway, since I no longer work in the Enron building,
it would probably be easiest to drop a check in the
mail:

Reagan Mathews
17210 Canyon Stream Ct.
Houston, TX  77095

By my calculation the amount should be:
$608.5

(1614-840) x 75% = 580.5 + $28 = $608.5.

$28 comes from...my total costs of -132, plus my paid
amount of 120, plus my winnings of 40. 

The reason I bring this up is that it looks like the
""Finances"" page of the website is double counting the
$50 entry fee.  Anyway, let me know if you have a
different number for the distributions.

So long,"Hey y'all,

as most of you would probably know by now, I have chosen to leave Enron to
pursue other opportunities.  It's been a good time (4+ years) with great
experiences both in North/South America and in Europe.

I'd like to use this e-mail to thank everybody for their good work and
friendship.  In particular (in order of appearance): Dung Tran, Jon Doyle,
Dave Ramm, Natalie Halich, Roberto Silveira and Rick Waddell have been great
sources of learning and leadership.

'Other opportunities' means exactly that - not quite sure what the next
adventure will be, but it won't be boring!  I encourage you to reply with
your personal e-mail etc., so that we can keep in touch.

All the best,
Christian

Power Trader Position,"I saw a job posting for a Power Trader (24-Hr real time) in the Enron intranet and I was wandering if we could meet to discuss further. 

I have been with Enron for about a year doing power origination and trading in Latin America. I recently moved back to the US and have been working with EES for a couple of months. Before Enron I worked a few years in PSEG trading and Constellation Power Source, but not as a trader. I know the northeast (PJM mainly) power markets (24 hour) fairly well. I have always been interested in getting into the trading business and that's why this position caught my attention.

I hope you feel there may be a potential match here. If you think so, please let me know and I can forward you my resume.

Thank you

OU Salaries,"Sally,

Just something from a recruiting prospective for us to think about, 
remembering the situation from last fall of George making the mistake of 
extending verbal offers, quoting incorrect salaries, and the difference being 
recovered by your RC, I wanted to bring the potential of a residual OU salary 
issue to your attention.  

The salary being offered for another internship or full-time position, which 
ever applies, may appear (to the OU candidates) to be wrong.  Interns will 
enter the program at the same pay rate, $3,000 monthly and the full-time 
analysts at 40k.  As you know, both salaries are non-negotiable for 
consistency amongst the program participants.  

I'm sure questions will come up regarding compensation and thought we could 
discuss the inevitable.  I would really like your input on how to ""soften the 
blow"".

I look forward to your response.
Thanks

Hourly Trading,"Hello Don,

I am trying to get a job in the 24 hour trading group.  I was speaking with John Zurita and he said that
you would be a good person to contact.  Currently, I am in the Risk Controls Group with EES working 
strictly with Power deals.  I have been running a small group for the past year called the Contract Post-Pricing Group.  
In addition, I have experience in the Power Underwriting Group and have exposure to various pricing 
strategies, concepts and products.  

I have attached my resume that will give you more detail about my work experience.

I will give you a call later today. 

Sincerely, 

Joe Capasso

2001 Plan vs 2000 Forecast Explanation,"Sarah,
Below is our high level explanation of the Energy Operations (including EOL) 
increase in 2001 plan over 2000 forecast of $5.1 million.  If you have any 
questions, please let me know.


Energy Operations has experienced a 140% increase in transaction growth as a 
result of EOL activity, requiring additional resources to support this new 
business.  However, resources have only increased at a rate of 11% due to the 
efficient use of existing resources.  As a result the per unit cost of 
supporting individual transactions has decreased significantly in the 100% to 
400%+ range.

A note on PMA's,"You may notice that 9911 PMA's are $(208,881) or approx 10% to the final 
P&L.  You will also notice that the detail following the majority of the 
adjustments is Unaccounted For Gas.  At the close of business for the 991 
P&L, we saw a gain of approx. $250,000 because of a blowout in UA4.  We 
thought that it would be prudent to top level this amount and use it to 
offset the PMA's we would take as a result of this UA4 blowout.  Therefore, 
the net impact of 9911 PMA's is $41,119 or 2% of last day P&L.

I just wanted to congratulate the team on a great P&L for the month of 
November.

2000 Accomplishments,"Patti delivered to Sharron's desk this week a copy of my 2000 
accomplishments.   You should find that when you return to the office.  Let 
me know if for some reason you do not have that copy, and I will have another 
delivered.  

Have a happy new year!  I will be at the Cotton Bowl watching Meagan's drill

questions, please let me know.


Energy Operations has experienced a 140% increase in transaction growth as a

business.  However, resources have only increased at a rate of 11% due to the

Re: Next Week,"I have asked my assistant Patti to help me in setting up meetings for next

time for just the two of us to get together.  

We are continuing the worldwide operations/controls review at the request of 
the two Rick's (Causey and Buy).  That will include a look at Continental 
power, UK power, UK gas and global products.  Looks as if sometime in April 
will be the date for that, however, not next week.  --Sally

	- OATT Tariff Attachments that includes Attachment F, Network Service Agreement and Attachment G, Network Operating Agreement

If EPMI does not already have the Network Transmission Agreements in place, then CG&E indicated that the process was to first fill out the Network Application and then they will send the Network Service Agreement and the Network Operating Agreement.

I have been with Enron for about a year doing power origination and trading in Latin America. I recently moved back to the US and have been working with EES for a couple of months. Before Enron I worked a few years in PSEG trading and Constellation Power Source, but not as a trader. I know the northeast (PJM mainly) power markets (24 hour) fairly well. I have always been interested in getting into the trading business and that's why this position caught my attention.

Re:,"Traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip.  
Especially if you have to prepare a presentation.  I would suggest holding 
the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business 
meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is 
even desired or necessary.

As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try 
and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working 
and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet 
just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a 
round table discussion format.  

My suggestion for where to go is Austin.  Play golf and rent a ski boat and 
jet ski's.  Flying somewhere takes too much time.

Re: Do you want to reschedule a catch up ?,"Tried you this morning from the car and missed you.  Do you want to talk 
Thursday morning during my commute?  I will be out of the office Friday, 
March 2 and Monday, March 5.  I will be a chaperone for my daughter's high 
school drill team to state competition in Dallas - really a Texas 
experience!  A great time to support her and be around her friends.   And 
nicely enough, she asked me to be a chaperone.  With 81 girls on the team, it 
will be loud, but fun.  --Sally

Re: Facility Fees,"Facility fees should be part of the accrual value that fall's out each month 
( as long as the deals are in the WH portfolio).  This value should not be 
given to Sharp unless he bears the cost of the facilities.  There is a file 
in my folder that has a listing of some of the deals that have facility 
fees.  For further info contact Vance Taylor. (the file is called fac costs)

In addition,  I am forwarding an e-mail sent by George Weissman to me 
regarding accrual value.  He thinks that the Coastal Deal that shows up as a 
huge negative each month should have been restructured in April.  Could you 
check into this and get back to him?

The top 25 exposures include the top exposures under Master agreements and in many cases include numerous contracts.  Chris said that the 26th exposure was about $10MM and one would need to get to about the 50th exposure to get below $1MM.  I asked him to forward down whatever they had completed to date so we could get educated and keep a central file.

In previous years Enron has sponsored athletic tournaments for it's 
employees.  I have participated in tournaments ranging from softball to flag 
football.  In addition, Enron has been very invloved with charitable

propose a flag football tournament to benefit a charitable organiztion.  I 
know that some of the budgets for sports clubs have been reduced (including 
flag football) recently.  This is a way that Enron can support employee

I just converted and moved Larry Campbell (lcampbe) to the W2K server.  He 
uses ESIS.  I successfully converted the tables and have the links corrected 
(logged in as kgramse), however Larry cannot use the system.  I received a 
message while logged in as Larry stating that the data/application was 
""Read-Only"" when I attempted to re-link the tables.
